Hey there! Thanks for the interest in this fork of wingpanel-indicator-ayatana. Unfortunately, between classes and other time-consuming matters, I haven't had the chance to work on this in a long time. If you're looking for a version that fixes and updates some more things, please check out the fork at:

<h1>Easy Install (user only)</h1>
1. Download the deb file (zip) and launch install<br/>

<h2>Parameters for Pantheon (eos)</h2>
2. You need to add Pantheon to the list of desktops abled to work with indicators:<br/>
<ul>
<li>With autostart (thanks to JMoerman) </li>
just add /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/indicator-application/indicator-application-service as custom command to the auto start applications in the system settings.
System settings -> "Applications" -> "Startup" -> "Add Startup Appâ€¦" -> "Type in a custom command".
No need for manually editing files using root and no risks of .desktop files being overwritten.
<br/>

<li>With the terminal (thanks to ankurk91) </li>
Open Terminal and run the following commands.
<pre>mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
cp /etc/xdg/autostart/indicator-application.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
sed -i 's/^OnlyShowIn.*/OnlyShowIn=Unity;GNOME;Pantheon;/' ~/.config/autostart/indicator-application.desktop
</pre><br/>

<li>Editing files (more risks)</li>
<pre>sudo nano /etc/xdg/autostart/indicator-application.desktop</pre>
Search the parameter: OnlyShowIn= and add "Pantheon" at the end of the line : 
<pre>OnlyShowIn=Unity;GNOME;Pantheon;</pre>
Save your changes (Ctrl+X to quit + Y(es) save the changes + Enter to valid the filename).<br/>
</ul>

3.<b>reboot</b>.
